    I took inspiration from this Jupyter Notebook (for the same dataset) which used cosine similarity and bigrams from scikit-learn's TfidfVectorizer to find similar books based on the title word frequencies. I used this as a base to build my own model which analyzed trigrams from the book descriptions rather than title or author, as well as some extra functionalities.

    This article's book recommendation algorithm (for a different dataset) inspired and taught me additional ways to improve my data processing such as adding a "Weighted Rating" column or how to work with my results after the running my similarity algorithm.

- Some of the CSS was suggested by Chat-GPT based off code I wrote myself. It was mainly used to help with code relating to the ```margin```, ```padding```, and ```border```. Some suggestions were also given about aesthetics like making the cursor become a pointer near buttons or slight shadows under text.
